# CalculatorOO
This is a port to C++ from Alpertron prime factorization calculator (https://github.com/alpertron/calculators).  Alpertron code is highly optimized but hard to to share in the current state. The goal here is to reorganize his code to eventually share it as libraries or serverless functions
